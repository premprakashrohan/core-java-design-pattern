 * 3. Behavioral
Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.

Behavioral patterns are Chain of responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Null Object, Observer, State, Strategy, 
Template method, Visitor

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects.
In these design patterns,the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled.
That means the implementation and the client should be loosely coupled in order to avoid hard coding and dependencies.
There are 12 types of structural design patterns:

    Chain of Responsibility Pattern
    Command Pattern
    Interpreter Pattern
    Iterator Pattern
    Mediator Pattern
    Memento Pattern
    Observer Pattern
    State Pattern
    Strategy Pattern
    Template Pattern
    Visitor Pattern
    Null Object
