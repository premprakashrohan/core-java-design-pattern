/**
 * By contrast, the Abstract Factory Design Pattern is used to create families of related or dependent objects. 
 * It’s also sometimes called a factory of factories.
 * 

The GoF definition states that an Abstract Factory “provides an interface for creating families of related or
 dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes”.
 When to Use Abstract Factory Pattern:
The client should be independent of how the products are created and composed in the system
The system consists of multiple families of products, and these families are designed to be used together
We need a run-time value to construct a particular dependency
