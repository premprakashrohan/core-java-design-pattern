/**
 * When to Use Factory Method Design Pattern
When the implementation of an interface or an abstract class is expected to 
change frequently
When the current implementation cannot comfortably accommodate new change
When the initialization process is relatively simple, and the constructor only 
requires a handful of parameters
Factory Method design pattern could be used to create objects related 
to a single family.
